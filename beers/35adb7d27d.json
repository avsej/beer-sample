The wonderful hop aroma is balanced nicely with a toasty malt body, ending with a cleansing hop finish. Made with English Pale, Munich, Vienna, and Crystal malts, and generously hopped with Amarillo, Perle, and Cascade hops. Fermented with our English ale yeast.\r\n\r\nFood Pairings: The bracing bitterness of this beer can hold its own with spicy foods, while helping to cleanse the palate after rich, creamy dishes. The citrus hop flavors go exceptionally well with any dishes using cilantro, such as Mexican salsas.\r\n\r\nOG: 14.0 Plato\r\nFG: 3.3 Plato\r\nIBUs: 55\r\nSRM: 6\r\n5.8% abv","style":"American-Style Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
