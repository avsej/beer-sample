We use the finest floor-malted Maris Otter malts from England, the same malts used for the best single-malt scotch. A portion of malted rye gives a spicy, slightly dry finish.\r\n\r\nFood Pairings: The rich, chocolate notes pair well with the carmelized surface of steaks, pork tenderloins and lamb, but save this beer for dessert if you’re having chocolate or crème brulée.\r\n\r\nOG: 14.40 Plato\r\nFG: 3.8 Plato\r\nIBUs: 28\r\nSRM: 29\r\n5.7% abv","style":"Porter","category":"Irish Ale"}
